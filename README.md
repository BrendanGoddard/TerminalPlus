The C++ and AI Terminal Wrapper is an intelligent command-line assistant that transforms traditional low-level terminal operations into simple, natural-language instructions. Instead of manually typing system commands like netstat, mkdir, or cd, users can describe what they want to do in plain English — and the wrapper interprets and executes the appropriate C++ system calls under the hood.

This tool aims to make terminal usage faster, more intuitive, and more interactive, bridging the gap between natural language and system-level functionality. It’s designed for both learning and productivity — giving developers, students, and AI enthusiasts a smarter way to handle directory management, network diagnostics, and other core terminal tasks.
